title: Hello, I fired up a blog on GitHub today.
---

I will start my blog recording the project on collaborative writing.

I'll conduct a language exchange experiment of writing for English learners and Chinese learners. A certain number of subjects are needed. If you have an interest in this experiment for my dissertation please let me know.

We've launched an [organization](https://github.com/opencollaborativeclass) in the way of [open research](https://github.com/opencollaborativeclass/OpenResearch) on GitHub, the platform on which our experiments will be conducted. 

[Here](https://github.com/opencollaborativeclass/OpenResearch/issues/3) is the issue detailing our research.

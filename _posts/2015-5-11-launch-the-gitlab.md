title: I launched the local gitlab
---

My supervisor had me fire up a local gitlab platform in virtual machine for research use a week ago.    

I struggled to manage it under the guidance of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zimaEg-MLN4). That tutorial is detailed and awesome, but as a newbie I encountered three snags as follows.   

1. Using the ubuntu server 14.04 LTS without x window, I was confused when the lecturer used the browser. So, I installed the x window.    
1. I cannot dig it out to make the external_url I set works. I am using the VMware Workstation and for the network connectivity I chose bridged networking.   
1. Wanting to share this server with my teacher in the same local area network, I tried my best to set the networks but failed. My physical computer accesses the Internet via Wifi with a dynamic ip. 

Much should be down including customizing the user interface using the mush-up technology.
